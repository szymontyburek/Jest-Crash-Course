What I learned:
- The different types of testing (unit, integration, end-to-end).
- How to unit test both synchronous and asynchronous functions.
- How to test the behavior of a function that is called indirectly by other code (mock functions).
- The effieciency of TDD. Developers can save lots of time through automated testing.
